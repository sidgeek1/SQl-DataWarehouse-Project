🧠 Data Warehouse & Analytics Project

Welcome to my Data Warehouse & Analytics Project — a complete end-to-end data engineering and analytics solution that demonstrates modern data warehousing, ETL design, and business intelligence practices.

Built as a portfolio project, it highlights scalable data architecture, robust SQL development, and analytical storytelling.

🏗️ Data Architecture — Medallion Design

This project follows the Medallion Architecture with three layers: Bronze, Silver, and Gold.

Bronze Layer: Ingests raw data from CSV files into SQL Server.

Silver Layer: Cleanses, standardizes, and transforms data for consistency.

Gold Layer: Curates analytical models (star schema) for business insights and reporting.

📖 Project Overview

The project covers all key aspects of a modern data warehouse lifecycle:

Data Architecture — Designed a modular Medallion-based architecture.

ETL Pipelines — Built SQL-based ETL workflows to integrate and transform ERP & CRM data.

Data Modeling — Created fact and dimension tables optimized for analytical queries.

Analytics & Reporting — Developed SQL-driven insights and Power BI dashboards.
